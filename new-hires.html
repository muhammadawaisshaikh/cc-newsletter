                  <br>
                  There are multiple reasons for that, company culture and values, challenging opportunity, vision alignment and great leadership, to name a few.</p>
                  <p>

                      Doctor. My father, who is a very good doctor, is my role model. I always wanted to serve humanity like him but things turned out differently.

                  <b>1) What made you choose Creative Chaos?</b>
                  <br>
                  I was excited to take up the challenge of rebuilding HR at Creative Chaos from the ground up. I was also inspired by the vision of the senior management.</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>2) What do you consider to be your greatest achievement?</b>
                    <br>
                    I consider every person I've helped within the capacity of my role in HR as a personal achievement, be it with a trivial problem someone’s facing at the work place or their professional aspirations. Professionally though, I have set very high standards for myself and consider everything I do at my job as a responsibility as well as what is expected of me. My role as an HR person is to ensure that there are no obstacles barring an associate from giving their absolute best at work so if I’m able to do that, I’m only meeting my goals. Having said that, maybe I’ll consider it an achievement if I’m able to help make Creative Chaos’s HR department one of thestrongest in 2019.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b> 3) If you had a choice to land up in a profession other than your current one, what would that be?</b> 
                      <br>
                      None. I chose HR as it is connected to my purpose in life, which is to help people. I enjoy my work, but it’s the people around me that I enjoy connecting with. Talking to them and helping them understand how I can help them is always a rewarding experience.

                  <b>1) What made you choose Creative Chaos?</b>
                  <br>
                    I wanted to experience the software industry so I researched for the best names in the market and saw Creative Chaos among the top ones. I chose to be a part of it because of the professional environment and the learning and development opportunities it offers to all its associates.</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>2) What do you consider to be your greatest achievement?</b>
                    <br>
                    During my tenure in the telecommunication industry, I managed turnkey roll out, expansion and transmission deployment of more than 200 WIMAX sites. Furthermore, I have completed my PMP diploma recently

                    <br>
                    Actually, I entered project management accidentally. I originally planned to be a marketing manager or a brand manager as I have a degree in Marketing. So, if I hada choice, I would go in the field of marketing.

                    I would like to be a Cisco Network Professional. At the moment, my domain containsoverall IT work but I would like a job with dedicated networking work. Apart from that, I’ve always been interested in the inner workings of all types of hardware (like how padlocks work) so maybe I would have chosen something in manufacturing or assembling

                  I was looking to join a company that could provide a challenging environment to exercise my skills and add value to it. In addition to that, I wanted it to be financiallystable with superb reputation in the market. I found all these qualities in Creative Chaos which has been doing remarkably well in the business since 2000</p>

                  Well, it's hard to pick one but I think developing the re-booking flow for Saudi Airlines’ website was my biggest achievement as it had required in-depth knowledge of ticket booking system.

                    Although computer science was my first choice, I could also have chosen electronicsas my profession because I love to acquire in-depth knowledge about electronic devices and try to integrate them with software
