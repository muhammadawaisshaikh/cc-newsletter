              <h1>A New Organizational Structure: From Traditional to Matrix</h1>
              <p>Earlier this year, Creative Chaos evolved from a traditional hierarchy to an agile matrix structure.The shift was a result of inefficiencies caused by the previous structure, which led to hierarchicalrigidity and internal silos; coordination between departments was poor and affected the quality of project delivery. After extensive research, discussion, and evaluation of options best suited forthe company, a unanimous decision was taken to introduce the matrix structure.The matrix structure introduces terms such as squads, chapters, chapter leads, project owners, coaches and squad members. The idea is to create squads for each project that are independently responsible for the end to end delivery of a project. This will lead to better collaboration between squad members from different chapters, create better synergies and leadto quality product delivery. So let’s see how the new structure fares compared to the previous one and whether it will work for Creative Chaos in the long run. </p>

              <p>It’s not every day that the world’s most celebrated tech company with military-grade security fails to spot a few bugs. Two of our associates, <b>Shayan Hussaini and Arjun Bhatnagar</b>, found a bug in Google’s AutoAL architecture. It took two weeks of continuous back and forth to get in touch with Google’s Chief Architect. The team at Google vehemently disagreed, but our associates weren’t ready to back off and pointed out the architectural flaws in an intense discussion. Finally, after a long-winded debate, Google acknowledged the bugs and appreciated the efforts of Shayan and Arjun. </p>
